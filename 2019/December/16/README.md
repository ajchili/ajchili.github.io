# December 12th - Following up on my Schedule
After spending a couple of days tracking how much time I spend doing different
tasks, I have realized that my original categories of time are not
representative of what my time is actually being spent on. Rather than using the
all of the original categories I have changed some:
- School
- Work
- ~~Personal Work~~ Personal
- ~~Personal~~ Entertainment
- Sleep

| Date | Time Tracked | School | Sleeping | Working | Personal | Entertainment |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 12/12 | 24 | 4 | 10 | 0 | 7 | 3 |
| 12/13 | 21 | 1 | 8 | 1 | 9 | 2 |
| 12/14 | 23 | 1 | 10 | 0 | 7 | 5 |
| 12/15 | 23 | 2 | 6 | 0 | 12 | 3 |

Base on the data I collected over the past 4 days, I can conclude that I
prioritize my time and time spent entertaining myself (generally video games or
YouTube), more than time spent working. This is a habit that I want to change
due to a lack of accomplishment. Alongside this desire to change my scheduling
habits, the fall semester is wrapping up. This will allow me to allocate time
that I normally dedicate to school (driving to/from, attending class, doing
homework, etc.) for work. Alongside this, I plan to better prioritize my
free time that I allocate to personal and entertainment activities so that I can
have a proper work life balance. Again, I plan to track the time I spend within
the categories above so that I can determine if I was able to actively make a
change to my schedule.
