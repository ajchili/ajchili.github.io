# December 12th - Starting a Blog
I have been itching to start a blog and do something productive for a while now,
but I have not been acting on those desires. To be more specific, I want to pick
up more work with [RAINN](https://www.rainn.org/), by increasing the time I
dedicate to my work with them, and start dedicating time to a side project
over a weekly/monthly period. I believe this to be a result of my heavy
course load with school, at 19 credits for this semester, and high desire to
play video games to remove stress.

The following are high action items that I want to focus on over the rest of
December:
- Increase number of hours worked for [RAINN](https://www.rainn.org/) to at
least 20 per week
- Create a mobile app similar to [Fuelly](http://www.fuelly.com/) so that I can
track gas consumption of my car
- Start work on v2 of [Couple List](https://github.com/CoupleList) and migrate
away from [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

To help myself keep track of progress I will start taking note of how many hours
and breaking down my time into the following categories:
- School
- Work
- Personal Work
- Personal
- Sleep

By breaking down my time into these categories, I can see where I am dedicating
the most amount of my time and cut back or add time to each category
accordingly. Then once changes are made, I can compare time spent in a previous
week with another week to determine the effectiveness of this plan. Ideally I
would make an app to track this time, such as a simple web app, but I think it
will be more efficient to just keep a note file with these times within it.
